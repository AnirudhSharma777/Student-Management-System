## ðŸ“¦ Features

- CRUD operations for Student entities
- Embedded Address object per student
- Uses MySQL container via Docker
- Secure password handling (with future support for hashing)
- Exception handling (e.g., student not found)
- DTO-based request/response layer
- Configurable with `application.yml`

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL 8 (via Docker)
- Hibernate
- Lombok

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnirudhSharma777/Student-Management-System.git
cd student-management-system
````

### 2. Start MySQL using Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This sets up a MySQL 8 container with:

* Database: `student_db`
* User: `username`
* Password: `password`

### 3. Configure Spring Boot

Ensure your `application.yml` contains:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_db
    username: username
    password: password
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true
    properties:
      hibernate:
        format_sql: true
        dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
```

### 4. Run the Application

Use your IDE or the command line:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
